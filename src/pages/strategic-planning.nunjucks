        <div class="service-plug">
          <p>At its most basic level, Integrated Marketing Communications, or IMC, as we’ll call it, means integrating all the promotional tools, so that they work together in harmony.</p>
          <p>Promotion is one of the Ps in the marketing mix. Promotions has its own mix of communications tools.</p>
          <p>All of these communications tools work better if they work together in harmony rather than in isolation. Their sum is greater than their parts – providing they speak consistently with one voice all the time, every time.</p>
